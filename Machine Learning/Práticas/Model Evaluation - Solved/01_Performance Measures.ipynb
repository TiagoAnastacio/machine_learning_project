    "\n",
    "### What is a Classification Threshold?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most classification models (like Logistic Regression) don't directly output class labels (0 or 1). Instead, they output **probabilities** that represent the model's confidence that an instance belongs to the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Probability = 0.85 → Model is 85% confident this is a positive case\n",
    "- Probability = 0.23 → Model is 23% confident this is a positive case\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert these probabilities into actual predictions (0 or 1), we need to set a **threshold**:\n",
    "- If probability ≥ threshold → Predict **Positive (1)**\n",
    "- If probability < threshold → Predict **Negative (0)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The default threshold is usually 0.5**, but this is not always optimal!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Does the Threshold Matter?\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Lower threshold (e.g., 0.3)**: \n",
    "  - More instances classified as positive\n",
    "  - Higher recall (catch more positives)\n",
    "  - Lower precision (more false positives)\n",
    "  - Use when: Missing a positive case is very costly\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher threshold (e.g., 0.7)**:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Multiclass Confusion Matrix (3.1)**:\n",
    "   - K × K matrix showing all classification outcomes\n",
    "   - Diagonal = correct predictions, off-diagonal = confusions\n",
    "   - Essential first step to understand error patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Macro Averaging (3.2)**:\n",
    "   - Simple average of per-class metrics\n",
    "   - Treats all classes equally\n",
    "   - **Use when**: All classes are equally important\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weighted Averaging (3.3)**:\n",
    "   - Weighted average by class frequency\n",
    "   - Accounts for class imbalance\n",
    "   - **Use when**: Class frequency reflects importance\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Micro Averaging (3.4)**:\n",
    "   - Global aggregation of TP, FP, FN\n",
    "   - Equals accuracy in multiclass\n",
    "   - **Use when**: Overall accuracy is the priority\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree for Choosing Averaging Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Do all classes have equal importance?\n",
    "├─ YES → Use MACRO averaging\n",
    "└─ NO → Is class frequency aligned with importance?\n",
    "    ├─ YES → Use WEIGHTED averaging\n",
    "    └─ NO → Consider MACRO or define custom weights\n",
    "    \n",
    "Want overall accuracy?\n",
    "└─ Use MICRO averaging (or just accuracy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Workflow:**\n",
    "1. Start with **confusion matrix** to see where errors occur\n",
    "2. Check **per-class metrics** (average=None) to identify problem classes\n",
    "3. Choose averaging method based on your business requirements:\n",
    "   - Equal class importance → **macro**\n",
    "   - Natural class imbalance → **weighted**\n",
    "   - Overall performance → **micro** (accuracy)\n",
    "4. Use **classification_report** for comprehensive overview\n",
